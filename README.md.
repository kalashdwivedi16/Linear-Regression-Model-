Sales Forecasting using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to forecast monthly sales revenue using Linear Regression. It uses synthetic data with various influencing factors to model and predict revenue trends.

Project Structure

Input Variables:
  Marketing Spend: Monthly marketing budget.
  Promotion_Flag: Binary flag indicating promotional activity.
  Season: Categorical variable for seasonal impact.
  Product_Category: Product types A, B, or C.
  Channel: Sales channel – Online, Retail, or Distributor.

Target Variable:
  Revenue: Simulated sales revenue generated from a combination of above factors with added noise.

Methodology

1. Data Generation:
   12 months of synthetic data generated using numpy and pandas.
   Revenue is calculated using a linear formula with added Gaussian noise.

2. Preprocessing:
   Dropped the Month column.
   Categorical features encoded using `pd.get_dummies()` (one-hot encoding).

3. Modeling:
   Linear Regression model from sklearn.linear_model.
   Fitted on encoded features and revenue.

4. Evaluation:
   Predicted on training data.
   Metrics such as RMSE and R² Score (not shown but implied in imports).

5. Visualization:
   (If included): Use of `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for potential visualizations.

Requirements
